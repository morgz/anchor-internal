# AnchorInternal

Internal Anchor tags jitter. Tested in Safari.

* Start the server
* Head to `http://localhost:4000/#section-3`
* Scroll back to top of page
* Hit reload âŒ˜r
* Page jumps immediately to #section-3, but then on second paint goes back to top of page.

Expect it to just rest on #section-3


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
